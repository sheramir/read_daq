2. **Background processing** handles FFT and statistics computation
3. **Memory management** optimizes allocation and cleanup
4. **GUI updates** are rate-limited to 30Hz for responsiveness
5. **Performance monitoring** tracks system health

### Visual Indicators
- Status bar shows "High-Performance Mode - 50000 Hz"
- Real-time rate accuracy: "Rate: 98.5% | Dropped: 0 | Buffer: 45.2%"
- Performance alerts appear if issues are detected
