Performance optimization suggestions for high-sampling-rate DAQ.

BOTTLENECK ANALYSIS:
==================

1. GUI Thread Blocking:
   - on_data_ready() processes data on main thread
   - FFT, filtering, statistics all run on GUI thread
   - Plot updates with large datasets block UI

2. Memory Issues:
   - Large numpy arrays created frequently
   - No circular buffers for continuous data
   - Full dataset kept in memory

3. Update Frequency:
   - GUI updates at data rate (10kHz = 10k updates/sec)
   - Plot updates should be much slower (~30-60 Hz)

SOLUTIONS:
==========

A. IMMEDIATE (Python-based):

1. Decouple Data Processing from GUI:
   ```python
   # Move to worker thread
   class DataProcessorWorker(QThread):
       processed_data = Signal(object)
       
       def process_data(self, t, y):
           # FFT, filtering, statistics here
           result = {...}
           self.processed_data.emit(result)
   ```

2. Limit GUI Update Rate:
   ```python
   # Update plots at fixed rate, not data rate
   self.gui_timer = QTimer()
   self.gui_timer.timeout.connect(self.update_plots)
   self.gui_timer.start(33)  # 30 Hz updates
   ```

3. Use Circular Buffers:
   ```python
   # Pre-allocate fixed-size buffers
   self.data_buffer = np.zeros((buffer_size, n_channels))
   self.buffer_index = 0
   ```

4. Optimize Plot Updates:
   - Use pyqtgraph's setData() efficiently
   - Downsample data for display
   - Use OpenGL acceleration

B. LANGUAGE ALTERNATIVES:

C++:
- 5-10x faster for numerical operations
- Better memory management
- No GIL limitations
- Qt available (same GUI framework)
- Direct NI-DAQmx C API access

Rust:
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Excellent performance (C++ level)
- Growing ecosystem for DAQ
- eframe/egui for GUI (simpler than Qt)

C. HYBRID APPROACH (Best of both worlds):

Python + C++ extension:
- Keep Python for GUI and logic
- C++ module for data processing
- Use pybind11 or Cython
- 80% of performance gain with 20% effort

BENCHMARKS (Typical):
====================
Operation               | Python  | C++    | Rust
FFT (8192 points)      | 10ms    | 2ms    | 2ms
Array operations       | 5ms     | 1ms    | 1ms
Memory allocation      | 2ms     | 0.5ms  | 0.3ms
GUI updates           | Same    | Same   | Different

RECOMMENDATION:
===============
1. First: Optimize Python version (A)
2. If still not enough: Hybrid approach (C)
3. Last resort: Full rewrite in C++/Rust (B)

For 10kHz, optimized Python should work fine.
For 100kHz+, consider C++/Rust.
